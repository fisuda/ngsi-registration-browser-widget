The NGSI Registration Browser [WireCloud widget](http://wirecloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) allows you to browse
the registrations used in a given
[Orion Context Broker](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker) server
in a easy and paginated way. This is done using the List Registrations querys, so updates made into the context broker
are not reflected immediately when using this widget.

## Build

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](http://node.js). For example, you can install it on Ubuntu and Debian running the
following commands:

```console
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
```

Install other npm dependencies by running:

```console
npm install
```

For build the widget you need download grunt:

```console
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And now, you can use grunt:

```console
grunt
```

If everything goes well, you will find a wgt file in the `dist` folder.
